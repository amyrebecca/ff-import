Wand requires v6.x of ImageMagick.

This can be installed on a mac by doing:

$ brew tap homebrew/versions
$ brew install imagemagick@6 --with-hdri --with-quantum-16
$ brew install imagemagick --with-hdri --with-quantum-32

You will need to add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:

export MAGICK_HOME=/usr/local/opt/imagemagick@6

DO NOT DO THIS
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/imagemagick@6/bin:$PATH"

Unfortunately, v6.x of ImageMagick does not handle the signed 16bit values
in the geotiffs correctly. This means that we get a lot of bad noise on
our images from sensor values between -2000 and 0, which are corrected for
properly by our use of the PLM script.

This way you can get both versions installed at once; we can use 7 from PLM
in order to fix the GEOTIFFs but have 6 installed for use with Wand
